## 🚀 About Me

I’m a data scientist and machine learning engineer with a strong foundation in **statistics, optimization, and applied AI**, focused on building **production-ready ML systems** and **quantitative models** that solve real-world problems.

My work spans **end-to-end ML pipelines** — from data engineering and feature extraction to model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of **AI, finance, and large-scale systems**, including quantitative trading strategies, alternative data, and intelligent decision-making platforms.

I enjoy working on problems that require both **mathematical rigor** and **engineering discipline**.
